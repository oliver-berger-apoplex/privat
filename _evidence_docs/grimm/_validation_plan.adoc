//Use the flag: requirement-proposal reason: Do not include risks and verification of a Use_case
//The requirements differ in the following aspects:
// the requirement/Use-Case has a medical use which gets reflected/displayed by an UI-element. These are the Use-cases which have to be validated by validation of UI. (e.g analysis-result) according to IEC 62366
//Requirements and Use-cases without clinical use. (e.g. Invoicing) Even if there is a UI, thiese requirements have not to be validated according to IEC-62366 because there is no associated risk
// requirements with a clinical use but without a UI-Elements (e.g. AI-algorithm). They have to be validated by the clinical evaluation. By proving that the results reflect the current state of knowledge (science and technology)

=== Intention of this document
This document describes the validation plannning. There are two different approaches to prove that we built the right software:

1. usability evaluation for all requirements and use cases therein with a medical use, that have UI elements (e.g analysis-result). These are the use-cases which have to be validated by validation of UI  according to IEC 62366
2. clinical evaluation: requirements with a clinical use but without a UI-Elements (e.g. AI-algorithm). They have to be validated by the clinical evaluation. By proving that the results reflect the current state of knowledge (science and technology)

All other requirements and use-cases without clinical use. (e.g. Invoicing). Even if there is a UI, these requirements have not to be validated according to IEC-62366 because there is no associated risk or harm for the patient.
