== Medical Device risk class

*_Risk class IIa (MDR, Annex VIII, rule 11)_*

Rules taken into consideration: MDR, Annex VIII

Non-Invasive device: Chapter 1 (pt. 2), Chapter 3, (pt. 4, Rule 1 - 4)

Invasive device: Chapter 1 (pt. 2), Chapter 3, (pt. 5, Rule 5 - 8)

#_Active devices: Chapter 1 (pt. 2), Chapter 3, (pt. 6, Rule 9 – 13)_#

Special rules: Chapter 1 (pt. 2), Chapter 3, (pt. 7, Rule 14 - 22)

=== Reasoning

Article 2 of EU-MDR (2017/745) defines a medical device and active device as follows:

‘Medical device’ means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical purposes

diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease,

diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability,

investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or pathological process or state,

providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from the human body, including organ, blood and tissue donations

‘Active device’ means any device, the operation of which depends on a source of energy other than that generated by the human body for that purpose, or by gravity, and which acts by changing the density of or converting that energy. Devices intended to transmit energy, substances or other elements between an active device and the patient, without any significant change, shall not be deemed to be active devices.

Software shall also be deemed to be an active device

As per MDCG 2019-11 Guidance on Qualification and Classification of Software in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 – MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 – IVDR, 

Defination of Medical Device Software (MDSW): 

Medical device software is software that is intended to be used, alone or in combination, for a purpose
as specified in the definition of a “medical device” in the MDR or IVDR, regardless of whether the software is independent or driving or influencing the use of a device.

==== Classification Rules: 

Since ARC is a medical device software, Rules 9 to 13 for active medical device and rule 22 for closed loop system are taken into consideration and are explaned as follows: 

*Rules 9, 10 and 12* are mainly associated with risks related to the exchange of energy/substances between the  body  and  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  active  devices,  taking  into  account  the  different  healthcare  situations (condition of patients). 

*_These rules do not apply to ARC as it is not a therapeutic device and will not be performing the stated function._* 

*Rule 22* is for Closed loop systems meaning that the active therapeutic devices with an integrated or incorporated diagnostic function which significantly determines the patient management by the device, such as closed loop systems or automated external defibrillators and such devices will be classified as class III.  

*_This rule also do not apply to ARC as it does not perform the stated purpose mentioned in the rule._* 

*Rule 11*: Software for decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes or software intended to monitor physiological processes  

#Rule 11 states: Software  intended  to  provide  information  which  is  used  to  take  decisions  with  diagnosis  or  therapeutic  purposes  is  classified  as  class  IIa#,  except  if  such  decisions  have  an  impact  that  may cause: death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of health, in which case it is in class III; or a serious deterioration of a person's state of health or a surgical intervention, in which case it is classified as class IIb.  

Software intended to monitor physiological processes is classified as class IIa, except if it is intended  for  monitoring  of  vital  physiological  parameters,  where  the  nature  of  variations  of  those parameters is such that it could result in immediate danger to the patient, in which case it is classified as class IIb.  

All other software is classified as class I. 

The text of Rule 11 can be divided into three sub-rules and are applied depending on the intended use/purpose of the MDSW: 

#11a:  (3  first  paragraphs  of  Rule  11)  intended  to  provide  information  which  is  used  to  take  decisions with diagnostic or therapeutic purposes;# 

#The  wording  “intended  to  provide  information  which  is  used  to  take  decisions  with  diagnosis  or  therapeutic purposes” describes, in very general terms, the “mode of action” which is characteristic of all  MDSW.    Therefore,  this  sub-rule  is  generally  applicable  to  all  MDSW  (excluding  those  MDSW  that have no medical purpose). Sub-rule  11a),  states  that  MDSW  (which  is  intended  to  provide  information  which  is  used  to  take  decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes) is classified as class IIa.# 

There  are  two  exceptions  from  sub-rule  11a)  that  are  mainly  intended  to  apply  a  risk  classification  based  on  the  significance  of  the  provided  information  and  the  potential  impact  of  an  (incorrect)  decision made using information from the MDSW.

Accordingly, MDSW that is intended to provide information which is used to take decisions with diagnosis and therapeutic purposes, is at a higher risk class where such decisions, if based on incorrect information from the MDSW, are reasonably likely to have an impact that may cause: i.death or an irreversible deterioration of a person's state of health, in which case it is in class III; ii.serious  deterioration  of  a  person's  state  of  health  or  surgical  intervention,  in  which  case  it  is  classified as class IIb.


11b: (Paragraph 4 of Rule 11) intended to monitor physiological processes or parameters; 

MDSW  that  is  intended  to  monitor  physiological  processes  will,  under  most  circumstances,  provide  “information  which  is  used  to  take  decisions  with  diagnosis  or  therapeutic  purposes  and  hence  fall  under  sub-rule  11a.  Sub-rule  11b)  should  therefore  be  considered  as  a  specific  rule  for  MDSW  intended only for monitoring purposes. Sub-rule 11b) was introduced to ensure that MDSW which has the same intended purpose as (hardware) devices which would fall under rule 10, third indent, are in the same risk class.  However,  this  sub  rule  applies  to  MDSW  intended  to  be  used  for  monitoring  any/all  physiological  processes and not just vital physiological processes (equivalent to rule 10, third indent).  Vital  physiological  processes  and  parameters  include,  for  example,  respiration,  heart  rate,  cerebral  functions, blood gases, blood pressure and body temperature.


11c: (Paragraph 5 of Rule 11) all other uses and implies that all other MDSW is classified as class I.

*_Since the intended purpose of ARC is to analyse the ECG data and provide information that will be used by the medical professionals to take decisions, therefore as per MDR, Annex VIII, rule 11, ARC is classified as Class IIa medical device._*
